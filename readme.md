Future features:
------
- Submitting feedback for now doesn't do anything. This could be updated so that each letter will be stored somewhere somehow so that the developers can read every letter that's been sent.
- Requesting recipe won't actually send a recipe to the email the user provided. This could be updated so that the recipe is sent to their provided email.
- Unique poster artwork design for Gessi Tonic, Irish Coffee, and Sparkling Liquid.
- More recipes
- More categories
- Filter section by the top, such as filtering out alcoholic drinks, or to only show sweet drinks
- Alcohol label to specify what drinks and ingredients contains alcohol

Typography and colour scheme:
------
Typography:
- Two fonts are being used: Kurale, and Arial.
- Kurale is the theme font. It appears for shorter text.
- Arial is the paragraph font. Its minimalist design and lack of stimulation makes it easy to read for a lenght of time. It's quite boring however, so it's used sparingly.

Colour scheme:
- The theme colour is red.
- The white and black are actually off-white, and dark blue. This creates an impression of 'down to earth modesty'.
- Each poster have their own colour scheme. What colour(s) depends on the desired impression.
- Because each poster's colour scheme is so diverse, every poster are grey in the home page until hovering, this is to prevent clashing user experience.

Testing:
------
Diversity of screen sizes:
- Using media queries, the appearance varies from device to device in a manner that's appropriate for such diversity.

Validator testing:
- No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
- No errors were returned when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

Fixed bugs:
- The footer used to be long, but now it appears normal.
- The Galaxy Fold media query was excluded and the page looked awkward, now the media query includes the fold as the smallest tested device.

Deployment:
- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
- The live link can be found here - https://github.com/MidnattLantern/elderflower_and_gin.git

Credits:
- The social media icons appearing at the footer were borrowed from fontawesome.com.
- The theme font is "Kurale", borrowed from fonts.google.com. Kurale is permitted to be used in this manner.
- All posters and artworks were designed and made by the same developer behind Elderflower and Gin.
- All text and paragraphs were written by the same developer behind Elderflower and Gin. GrammarlyGO was co-used as an advice tool on phrasing and choice of words.

Wireframes:
------
- Visualisation for front-end appearance was sketched with art software.
- The following images are wireframes to support as visual references during the early phase:
