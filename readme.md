Strategy:
 The realm of cocktails and drinks is a diverse domain of evocative experiences. The chronological plot from visual aesthetics to anticipation, and finally delivering the fulfillment upon imbibing. Elderflower and Gin, for the visitor who values fancy cocktails and drinks, serves an enjoyable and inspirational expedition in search of inspiration. Unlike conventional online forums, the act of browsing the cocktail catalog assimilates the soul and philosophy from websites such as Artstation and Pinterest. This deliberate approach to browsing the chronological plot reflects the cultural values and expectations of the intended visitors.
 For me, Elderflower and Gin is a let action show my skillsets, as a part of my professional portfolio. I intend to make an impression on my recruiters so that they can ensure that I'm confident in my discipline.

 Why not use another website?

 The emotional response of browsing the aesthetics determind whether or not it's worth diving into the facts and text and recipes and such
