1. Purpose of the prject:
Elderflower and Gin stores a diverse catalogue of recipes for cocktails and drinks, in an aeshetically pleasing way.

2. User Stories
When I pitched or showed the website to my friends, I discovered we all share the same experience about any recipe based website: the long content and texts around or before the main thing. My friends complemented my website for being so straight foward with the recipes. They jokingly called it DND cocktails

3. Features
One html page for each recipe, an art poster that sends you to an html for the page, a button on the top left corner that'll take you to the welcome page, a section for all drinks, a section for non-alcoholic drinks, request to send the recipe to your email, form to write a letter. Bigger screens have bigger scale posters, and red theme on the sides to validate the user who is using a mighty screen.

4. more drinks, more artwork, the request recipe will actually send the recipe to your email

5. fantasy themed, floral like characters, everything is painted with the computer

6. Sketching was done with pixel based software like Clip Studio Paint, and Affinity Photo 2. These softwares provide you free sketching just likeon paper and pencil. Then I tried some layout with vector based software: Affinity designer 2. Vector is used for HTML and CSS, so this was the appropriate approach, as you get to try layouts with intuitive interaction.

7. All the artwork was painted in Clip Studio Paint, Affinity Photo 2, and Affinity Designer 2. The code was written using Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Research on what you can do in html and css was researched on Code Institute, W3, Stack Overflow, and ChatGPT. The research was done for the purpose of knowing what tools are available, and no code (except for generic strings) have been copied from another user or AI generated strings. The code was simulated and ran trough Microsoft Edge.

8. testing
The current version have no errors in jugsaw or html valdator.
The website is responsive, as MS Edge has the phone and tablet simulator.

9. deployment
deployed trough Github

10. The font is borrowed from Google fonts, and the icons used for the footer is orrowed from from Font Awrseome. All coding is developed by ALma, and all artwork is oainted by ALma.
