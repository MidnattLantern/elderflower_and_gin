                Elderflower: <br><br>
        During a recent visit with a friend of mine who is a mother to two sons, we sat down at her place to discuss life. “May I offer you a drink my boys cannot resist?” Of course, I had to try. She walked to our table with two glasses in her hands and placed one in front of me. The size of the glass could probably keep me hydrated for the rest of the day. The water had a tint of green, and something floating on the surface that reminded me of the moss found inside the spruce forest next to her family’s house. I take my first zip. It’s slightly sour and bitter, yet fresh and addictive.<br><br>
        << As a mother, it’s my responsibility to keep my sons healthy. They’re so young and easily distracted, they forget to look after themselves. My younger son is packed with so much energy. He’s always doing something outside, like playing tag and such. I used to remind him to drink water so that his head wouldn’t spin him unconscious when he was leaping between two rocks. My older son is a bookworm. I used to tell him all the time that if he wants to remember the stuff he reads, he needs to treat his brain with water.
        That was until I began to carbonate the water, squeezed limes, and put the water inside a big container outside. Sometimes I add a couple of sliced limes, lemons, and zest so that it looks fun. Now I don’t have to remind them all the time.>> <br><br>
        Her story reminded me of how I sometimes forget to drink water myself. It can sometimes feel like a chore. I realize I’ve been keeping the glass to my mouth for the entire story.
        The lime juice makes me feel younger for every zip. The carbonatic acid forces me to savour it slowly, leaving me no choice but to slow down and enjoy the present.
