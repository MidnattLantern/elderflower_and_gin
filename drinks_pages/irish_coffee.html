        Gin’s suggested volume:<br>
        - 1 dl whisky,<br>
        - a cup of black coffee (about 2 dl),<br>
        - Use brown sugar,<br>
        - The cream should be whipped (a can of Reddi-Wip really helps),<br>
        - The more whisky, the more spice,<br>
        - The more cream, the more thickness.
        <br><br>
        If there’s a beverage equivalent to “one size fits all”, that would be Irish Coffee. This drink somehow embodies a prestigious luxury drink to offer my royal guests and a treat to the simple visitors who live from paycheck to paycheck. I offer this drink during serious meetings, and at the snack bar for standup night. I fuel myself with this drink during long days at work, and late at night to turn my head off. I offer this drink to connect with old and new friends, and I offer this drink to my enemies to find a middle ground.
        <br><br>
        The caffeine from the coffee sharpens your senses, while the alcohol from the whisky calms them down. I believe the combination of the two contributes to softening one’s temper, helping you stay calm under pressure, or remain calm under conflict. It may help you be more warm and let that ice melt until it breaks. It conserves and triggers energy to help you find things to say. This drink doesn’t spice up the stand-up night for nothing.
        <br><br>
        The coffee provides a pleasantly bitter taste that is balanced by the sweetness of brown sugar. Meanwhile, the whisky adds a smooth and comforting warmth to every sip. The drink is topped off with a decadent cloud of whipped cream, adding a luxurious finishing touch.
