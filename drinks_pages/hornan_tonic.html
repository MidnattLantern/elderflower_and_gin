        Ginâ€™s suggested volume: <br>
- 1/2 dl Gin, and 1/2 dl Elderflower liquor <br>
- One lime per serving <br>
- 0,75-litre tonic <br>
- Get the zest by grinding the surface of the lime, then squeeze out all the juice. Use a brush if the zest gets stuck on the grinder. <br>
- Add more or less tonic depending on the size of the glass. <br>
- For a sweeter taste, add more elderflower liquor, and for a crisper taste, add more gin. <br><br>
I was introduced to Elderflower through Hornan Tonic, a drink that I discovered during my hiking vacation in the Nordic fjords and lush lands. As someone driven by wanderlust, I sought inspiration to capture the sensations of this climate but struggled to put the Nordic breeze into words. I decided to find an alternative way to share my experiences with others.
<br><br>
During my travels, I met a fellow traveller who suggested a nearby bar located on a cliff with a stunning view of the lakes and tall mountains. The bartender recommended Hornan Tonic, a local drink that pays homage to the nature in the area. Intrigued, I ordered a glass.
<br><br>
As I sipped the drink on the balcony, I was transported back to my hiking adventures. The lime gave a refreshing zing like the forest breeze, while the gin's botanical notes reminded me of the lush meadows. The bubbles of tonic water brought to mind the sparkling lakes, and the subtle sweetness of the elderflower liquor danced through my taste buds like wildflowers in the fields. If you've tried Hornan Tonic, you've practtically already been at the Nordic fjords.
<br><br>
Next to me stood Elderflower. She had ordered the same drink, which was our icebreaker.
